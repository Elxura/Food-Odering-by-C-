1. The code begins with the necessary header files and a namespace declaration.

2. The struct `MenuItem` represents a single item in the menu. It has three members: `name` (string), `price` (integer), and `next` (a pointer to the next MenuItem in the list).

3. The class `MenuList` represents the menu list itself. It has one private member `head`, which is a pointer to the first item in the list.

4. The constructor `MenuList()` initializes the `head` pointer to NULL, indicating an empty list.

5. The `addMenuItem()` function adds a new MenuItem to the beginning of the list. It takes the name and price of the item as parameters, creates a new MenuItem dynamically, assigns the values, and updates the head pointer accordingly.

6. The `updateMenuItem()` function allows updating the price of an existing MenuItem. It traverses the list to find the MenuItem with the given name, and if found, updates its price.

7. The `deleteMenuItem()` function removes a MenuItem from the list based on its name. It traverses the list to find the MenuItem, adjusts the pointers of the previous and next items accordingly, and deletes the MenuItem.

8. The `displayMenu()` function traverses the list and prints the name and price of each MenuItem, displaying the entire menu.

9. The `placeOrder()` function allows the user to place an order. It prompts the user to enter the names of the items they want to order, calculates the total price by traversing the list and finding the corresponding MenuItems, and displays the total.

10. In the `main()` function, a `MenuList` object named `menuList` is created. A menu-driven loop is implemented using a `do-while` loop.

11. Inside the loop, the user is presented with several options: adding a menu item, updating a menu item, deleting a menu item, displaying the menu, placing an order, or exiting the program.

12. Depending on the user's choice, the corresponding member functions of the `MenuList` class are called to perform the desired operation.

13. The loop continues until the user chooses to exit by entering 0.
